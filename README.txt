File naming for I-PpoI is as follows:

For QM cluster models: Enzyme name (I-PpoI) is followed by methodology (QM Cluster), which is followed by the model name and the corresponding number of atoms, followed by the general acid (Mg or Mg-ligated water), followed by the type of stationary point (RC or TS or IC or PC)
Two ICs for 134-atom model (the first named 'IC' is obtained from TS2 and the second named 'ICP (prime)' is obtained from TS1.

For QM/MM models: Enzyme name (I-PpoI) is followed by methodology (QM/MM), which is followed by the general acid (Mg or Mg-ligated water), followed by the type of stationary point (RC or TS or PC).
EE refers to stationary points optimized using electrostatic emedding.
H98A refers to QM/MM H98 mutated to alanine in the preferred QM/MM pathway.
